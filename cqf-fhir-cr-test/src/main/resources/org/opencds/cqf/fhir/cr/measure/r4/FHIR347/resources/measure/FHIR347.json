  "rationale": "\"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, causing approximately 1 of every 3 deaths in the United States in 2015. In 2015, stroke caused approximately 1 of every 19 deaths in the United States and the estimated annual costs for CVD and stroke were $329.7 billion, including $199.2 billion in direct costs (hospital services, physicians and other professionals, prescribed medications, home health care, and other medical durables) and $130.5 billion in indirect costs from lost future productivity (cardiovascular and stroke premature deaths). CVD costs more than any other diagnostic group\" (Benjamin et al., 2018).\n\nData collected between 2011 and 2014 indicates that more than 94.6 million U.S. adults, 20 years or older, had total cholesterol levels equal to 200 mg/dL or more, while almost 28.5 million had levels 240 mg/dL or more (Benjamin et al., 2018). Elevated blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for CVD and statin therapy has been associated with a reduced risk of CVD. Numerous randomized trials have demonstrated that treatment with a statin reduces LDL-C, and reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events by approximately 20 percent (Ference, 2015).\n\nIn 2013, guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults were published (see Stone et al., 2014). This guideline was published by an Expert Panel, which synthesized evidence from randomized controlled trials to identify people most likely to benefit from cholesterol-lowering therapy. The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline recommendations are intended to provide a strong evidence-based foundation for the treatment of blood cholesterol for the primary and secondary prevention and treatment of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) in adult men and women (21 years of age or older). The document concludes the addition of statin therapy reduces the risk of ASCVD among high-risk individuals, defined as follows: individuals with clinical ASCVD, with LDL-C >= 190 mg/dL, or with diabetes and LDL-C 70-189 mg/dL (Stone et al., 2014).\n\nOne study that surveyed U.S. cardiology, primary care, and endocrinology practices found that 1 in 4 guideline-eligible patients were not on a statin and less than half were on the recommended statin intensity. Untreated and undertreated patients had significantly higher LDL-C levels than those receiving guideline-directed statin treatment (Navar et al., 2017). The Statin Safety Expert Panel that participated in an NLA Statin Safety Task Force meeting in October 2013 reaffirms the general safety of statin therapy. \n\nHowever, 1 in 10 people who try taking a statin will report some kind of intolerance, most commonly muscle aches. Other known low risk circumstances of statin intolerance include side effects such as myopathy, cognitive dysfunction, increased hepatic transaminase levels, and new onset diabetes. Statin intolerance usually does not involve substantial risk for mortality or permanent disability (Guyton et al., 2014). Ultimately, the panel members concluded that for most patients requiring statin therapy, the potential benefits of statin therapy outweigh the potential risks. In general terms, the benefits of statins to prevent non-fatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, stroke, and CVD mortality, far outweighs any potential harm related to the drug (Jacobson, 2014).",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "This electronic clinical quality measure is intended to align with the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol (Stone et al., 2014), which indicates the use of statins as the first line of cholesterol-lowering medication therapy to lower the risk of ASCVD among at-risk populations.\n\nRecommendations for Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults - Statin Treatment:\nSecondary Prevention:\n1. High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men <=75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated. (Level of Evidence A), (Stone et al., 2014)  \n\n2. In individuals with clinical ASCVD in whom high-intensity statin therapy would otherwise be used, when high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option, if tolerated. (Level of Evidence A), (Stone et al., 2014) \n\nPrimary Prevention in Individuals >= 21 Years of Age With LDL-C >=190 mg/dL:\n2. Adults >=21 years of age with primary LDL-C >=190 mg/dL should be treated with statin therapy. (10-year ASCVD risk estimation is not required.) (Level of Evidence B), (Stone et al., 2014)\n\nPrimary Prevention in Individuals With Diabetes and LDL-C 70-189 mg/dL:\n1. Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued for adults 40-75 years of age with diabetes. (Level of Evidence A), (Stone et al., 2014)",

  "guidance": "Numerator instructions and guidance:\n-Current statin therapy use must be documented in the patient's current medication list or ordered during the measurement period.\n-ONLY statin therapy meets the measure Numerator criteria (NOT other cholesterol lowering medications).\n-Prescription or order does NOT need to be linked to an encounter or visit; it may be called to the pharmacy.\n-Statin medication \"samples\" provided to patients can be documented as \"current statin therapy\" if documented in the medication list in health/medical record.\n-Patients who meet the denominator criteria for inclusion, but are not prescribed or using statin therapy, will NOT meet performance for this measure. There is only one performance rate calculated for this measure; the weighted average of the three populations.  \n-Adherence to statin therapy is not calculated in this measure.\n\nDenominator Guidance: \nThe denominator covers three distinct populations. Use the following process to prevent counting patients more than once.\n\nDenominator Population 1:  \nPatients aged >= 21 years at the beginning of the measurement period with clinical ASCVD\n\n-If YES, meets Denominator Population 1 risk category\t\t \n-If NO, screen for next risk category\n\nDenominator Population 2: \nPatients aged >= 21 years at the beginning of the measurement period who have ever had a fasting or direct laboratory test result of LDL-C >= 190 mg/dL or were previously diagnosed with or currently have an active diagnosis of familial or pure hypercholesterolemia\n\n-If YES, meets Denominator Population 2 risk category\t\t \n-If NO, screen for next risk category\n\nDenominator Population 3:\nPatients aged 40 to 75 years at the beginning of the measurement period with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and with a LDL-C result of 70 -189 mg/dL recorded as the highest fasting or direct laboratory test result in the measurement year or during the two years prior to the beginning of the measurement period\n\n-If YES, meets Denominator Population 3 risk category\n-If NO, patient does NOT meet Denominator criteria and is NOT eligible for measure inclusion\n\nDenominator Guidance for Encounter:\n-In order for the patient to be included in the denominator, the patient must have ONE denominator-eligible visit, defined as follows:\n\n--Outpatient encounter visit type\n--Encounter, performed: initial or established office visit, face-to-face interaction, preventive care services, or annual wellness visit\n\nLDL-C Laboratory test result options:\nThe measure can be reported for all patients with a documented fasting or direct LDL-C level recorded as follows:\n\nTo meet Denominator Population 1: \nThere is no LDL-C result required.\n\nTo meet Denominator Population 2:\nIf a patient has ANY previous fasting or direct laboratory result of LDL-C >= 190 mg/dL, report the highest value >= 190 mg/dL.\n\nTo meet Denominator Population 3: \nIf a patient has more than one LDL-C result during the measurement period or during the two years before the start of the measurement period, report the highest level recorded during either time. The Denominator Exception, \"Patients with diabetes who have the most recent fasting or direct LDL-C laboratory test result < 70 mg/dL and are not taking statin therapy\" applies only to Denominator Population 3.\n\nIntensity of statin therapy in primary and secondary prevention:\n\nThe expert panel of the 2013 ACC/AHA Guidelines (Stone et al., 2014) defines recommended intensity of statin therapy on the basis of the average expected LDL-C response to specific statin and dose. Although intensity of statin therapy is important in managing cholesterol, this measure assesses prescription of ANY statin therapy, irrespective of intensity. Assessment of appropriate intensity and dosage documentation added too much complexity to allow inclusion of statin therapy intensity in the measure at this time.\n\nLifestyle modification coaching:\nA healthy lifestyle is important for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, lifestyle modification monitoring and documentation added too much complexity to allow its inclusion in the measure at this time.\n\nThis eCQM is a patient-based measure.\n\nThis version of the eCQM uses QDM version 5.5.
