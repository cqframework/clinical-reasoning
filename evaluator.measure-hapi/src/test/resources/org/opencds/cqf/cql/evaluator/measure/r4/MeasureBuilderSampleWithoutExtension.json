  "rationale": "Inpatient hypoglycemia can be severe and life-threatening and is associated with longer hospital stays and increased medical costs (1-7). The prevalence of inpatient hypoglycemia varies with patient severity, hospital unit, time of episodes, and glycemic threshold. Severe hypoglycemia (<40 mg/dL) occurs in 2%-5% of hospitalized patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) while hypoglycemia <70 mg/dL has been reported in up to 10% of patients in the intensive care unit (8). Patients with DM comprise more than 25% of all U.S. inpatient stays and medication-related hypoglycemic events are common causes of adverse drug events (ADEs) occurring in inpatient settings (9,10). Rates of severe hypoglycemia vary across hospitals, suggesting opportunities for improvement in quality of care of glycemic control. Measurement of medication-related hypoglycemia in a meaningful and standardized way may improve glycemic management (11,12).",
  "definition": [ "Antidiabetic Drug Days (ADD): Aggregate number of inpatient encounter days within the facility in which at least one injectable or oral ADD was received. All patients who received ADDs during the hospitalization contribute to the denominator regardless of whether the patient experienced a hypoglycemic event.

Only Metric 1 includes ED visits and OBS. ", "Hypoglycemia Day: An inpatient day with at least one documented hypoglycemia event. ", "Hypoglycemia Event includes the following during an inpatient hospitalization: A hypoglycemic blood glucose (BG) result during the encounter and ADD administered within 24 hours prior to the start of the hypoglycemic BG result and no subsequent test for blood glucose with a result > 80 mg/dL within five minutes of the start of the initial low blood glucose test.", "Inpatient Encounter: A hospitalization in any inpatient facility that meets the criteria for reporting to the NHSN Glycemic Control Hypoglycemia Module (refer to CDC Locations and Descriptions manual).
