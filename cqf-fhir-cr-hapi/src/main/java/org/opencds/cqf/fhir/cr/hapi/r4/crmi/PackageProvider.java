     * Packages a specified canonical resource for use in a target environment, optionally including
     * related content such as dependencies, components, and test cases and data.
     * The package operation supports producing a complete package of a particular artifact
     * supporting the capabilities expected to be available in a particular target environment. For
     * example, a Questionnaire may be packaged together with the value sets referenced by elements
     * of the questionnaire, and those value sets may be definitions (Computable) or expansions
     * (Expanded), depending on the parameters to the operation.
     *
     * @param id                            The logical id of an existing Resource to package on the

     * @param capability                    A desired capability of the resulting package.

     *                                      not already specify a version. The format is the same as

     *                                      http://loinc.org|2.56 Note that this is a generalization
     *                                      of the system-version parameter to the $expand operation

     *                                      artifact resource. If the artifact referencing the
     *                                      resource specifies a different version, an error is
     *                                      returned instead of the package. The format is the same
     *                                      as a canonical URL: [url]|[version] - e.g.
     *                                      http://loinc.org|2.56 Note that this is a generalization
     *                                      of the check-system-version parameter to the $expand

     * @param forceArtifactVersion          Edge Case: Specifies a version to use for a canonical or
     *                                      artifact resource. This parameter overrides any
     *                                      specified version in the artifact (and any artifacts it
     *                                      depends on). The format is the same as a canonical URL:
     *                                      [system]|[version] - e.g. http://loinc.org|2.56. Note
     *                                      that this has obvious safety issues, in that it may
     *                                      result in a value set expansion giving a different list
     *                                      of codes that is both wrong and unsafe, and implementers
     *                                      should only use this capability reluctantly. It
     *                                      primarily exists to deal with situations where
     *                                      specifications have fallen into decay as time passes. If
     *                                      the version of a canonical is overridden, the version
     *                                      used SHALL explicitly be represented in the expansion
     *                                      parameters. Note that this is a generalization of the
     *                                      force-system-version parameter to the $expand operation
     *                                      to apply to any canonical resource, including code

     * @param manifest                      Specifies a reference to an asset-collection library
     *                                      that defines version bindings for code systems and other
     *                                      canonical resources referenced by the value set(s) being
     *                                      expanded and other canonical resources referenced by the
     *                                      artifact. When specified, code systems and other
     *                                      canonical resources identified as depends-on related
     *                                      artifacts in the manifest library have the same meaning
     *                                      as specifying that code system or other canonical
     *                                      version in the system-version parameter of an expand or
     *                                      the canonicalVersion parameter.
     * @param offset                        Paging support - where to start if a subset is desired
     *                                      (default = 0). Offset is number of records (not number
     *                                      of pages). It is invalid to request a 'transaction'
     *                                      bundle, via the bundleType parameter, and use paging.
     *                                      In this case, the implementation will return a paged

     *                                      in a partial page view. If count = 0, the client is
     *                                      asking how large the package is. If count > 0 but less
     *                                      than the total number of resources, the result will be a
     *                                      bundle of type collection. It is invalid to request a
     *                                      'transaction' bundle, via the bundleType parameter, and
     *                                      use paging. In this case, the implementation will
     *                                      return a paged searchset with an explanation of why that

     *                                      It is invalid to request a 'transaction' bundle and use

     * @param terminologyEndpoint           An endpoint to use to access terminology (i.e.
     *                                      valuesets, codesystems, naming systems, concept maps,
     *                                      and membership testing) referenced by the Resource. If
     *                                      no terminology endpoint is supplied, the server may use
     *                                      whatever mechanism is appropriate for accessing
     *                                      terminology. This could be the server on which the
     *                                      operation is invoked or a third party server accessible
     *                                      to the environment. When a terminology endpoint is
     *                                      provided, the server or third party servers may still be
     *                                      used as fallbacks.
     * @param requestDetails                The {@link RequestDetails RequestDetails}
     * @return  The result of the packaging. If the resulting bundle is paged using count or offset,
     *          it will be of type collection. In the special case where count = 0 it will be of
     *          type searchset.
     *          The first resource returned in the resulting package will be an outcome manifest
     *          that describes the results of the packaging operation. Clients consuming package
     *          bundles SHALL examine the contents of these OperationOutcome resources to understand
     *          whether the bundle contains the expected content (e.g. if a ValueSet could not be
     *          expanded).
     *          Servers generating packages SHALL include all the dependency resources referenced by
     *          the artifact that are known to the server and specified by the include parameters.
     *          For example, a measure repository SHALL include all the required library resources,
     *          but would not necessarily have the ValueSet resources referenced by the measure.
