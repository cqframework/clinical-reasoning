  "rationale": "Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancers, accounting for 15 percent of all new cancer diagnoses in the U.S. (Noone et al, 2018). In 2015, over 3 million women were estimated to be living with breast cancer in the U.S. and it is estimated that 12 percent of women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point during their lifetime (Noone et al, 2018). \n\nWhile there are other factors that affect a woman's risk of developing breast cancer, advancing age is a primary risk factor. Breast cancer is most frequently diagnosed among women ages 55-64; the median age at diagnosis is 62 years (Noone et al, 2018).\n\nThe chance of a woman being diagnosed with breast cancer in a given year increases with age. By age 40, the chances are 1 in 68; by age 50 it becomes 1 in 43; by age 60, it is 1 in 29 (American Cancer Society, 2017).",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 50-74 years (B recommendation). \n\nThe decision to start screening mammography in women prior to age 50 years should be an individual one. Women who place a higher value on the potential benefit than the potential harms may choose to begin biennial screening between the ages of 40 and 49 years (C recommendation). (USPSTF, 2016) \n\nThe USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women aged 75 years or older (I statement). (USPSTF, 2016) \n\nThe USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) as a primary screening method for breast cancer (I Statement). (USPSTF, 2016) \n\nThe USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adjunctive screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, DBT, or other methods in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram (I statement). (USPSTF, 2016)",
