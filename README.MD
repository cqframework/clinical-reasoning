# CQL Evaluator

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.opencds.cqf.cql/evaluator/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.opencds.cqf.cql/evaluator) [![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.com/DBCG/cql-evaluator.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.com/DBCG/cql-evaluator) [![project chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/zulip-join_chat-brightgreen.svg)](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179220-cql)

This project provides a Java-based [CQL](https://cql.hl7.org/) evaluation environment and related components.

The front-end of the evaluator is the [cql-to-elm translator](https://github.com/cqframework/clinical_quality_language/tree/master/Src/java) (which provides translation of CQL to [ELM](https://cql.hl7.org/elm.html)) and the backend is the [cql-engine](https://github.com/DBCG/cql_engine) (which provides ELM execution). The evaluator glues those two components together and provides DataProvider and TerminologyProvider implementations that allow execution of CQL against a filesystem, FHIR server, and in-process FHIR resources.

## Prerequisites

[Java 8+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

[Maven 3.5+](https://maven.apache.org/index.html)

## Usage

The cql-evaluator project includes a cli tool that allows execution of CQL from the command line. You can build this tool with:

```bash
mvn package
```

Then you can run the cli with:

```bash
java -jar ./evaluator.cli/target/evaluator.cli-2.2.0-shaded.jar --help
```

That will list the command line options. There is some CQL content available in the [Connectathon IG](https://github.com/DBCG/connectathon) repository. If you have that repository checked out as a sibling repo to this one, you can execute a sample Measure test case by running:

```bash
java -jar ./evaluator.cli/target/evaluator.cli-2.2.0-shaded.jar \
--lu ../connectathon/fhir4/input/pagecontent/cql \
--ln EXM104_FHIR4 \
-m FHIR=../connectathon/fhir4/input/tests/EXM104_FHIR4-8.1.000 \
-t ../connectathon/fhir4/input/vocabulary/valueset \
-c Patient=numer-EXM104-FHIR4
-fv R4
```
